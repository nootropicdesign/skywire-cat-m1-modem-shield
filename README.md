# Skywire Shield: Arduino shield for Nimbelink Skywire CAT M1 and NB IoT modems

This is a design for a simple Arduino shield for Nimbelink Skywire CAT M1 and NB IoT modems. Nimbelink modems are designed to have compatible pinouts and electrical characteristics, so it is possible to design a carrier board that works for a large variety of modems. The board has a switching power supply that provides 3.8V to the modem. Jumpers can be used to connect the modem's serial RX and TX to the Arduino hardware serial pins or to pins for use with software serial (digital pins 2 and 3).
